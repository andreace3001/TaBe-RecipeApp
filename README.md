### Recipe App

## Project Name: TaBe
### Team Members: Andre Acebal, Blake Warner, Charlie Phelps, Kyler Severance
### Senior Design Project

Project Scope: An iPhone app, similar to pinterest, that will allow users to find recipes based upon who they follow and based upon what they search. This app promotes variations of recipes so each user will be able to create a variation of a recipe that is posted to encourage people to try new things and create new foods. The app is meant to share different cultural foods and not promote people. A user can search recipes, save recipes in different folders to find them easily. This app is meant to promote people to cook more!
